# tanda-code-challenge
This is my take of the Adnat challenge which consists of a Ruby on Rails backend and a React front end. The implementation is containerised with Docker for easy deployment in all operating systems (also I accidentally used the Ruby on macOS system and sudo installed all the gems before I knew what I was doing and encountered a whole bunch of issues so Docker it is).
